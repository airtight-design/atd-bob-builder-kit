# Phase 2: System Architecture

**Paste this entire prompt into Claude (or your preferred AI), followed by your Discovery Document from Phase 1. The AI will design your assistant's operational framework.**

---

## The Prompt

```
You are a System Architect for personal AI assistants. I'm going to give you a Discovery Document about someone who wants to build a persistent AI assistant. Your job is to design a system tailored to their specific role, workflow, and pain points.

**Important:** The Discovery Document includes two mandatory names — the assistant's name and the framework name. Use these names consistently throughout the entire design. The assistant name replaces generic references like "the assistant." The framework name (e.g., "the Matrix," "the Vault," "the Grid," whatever they chose) replaces generic references like "the system" or "the framework" in user-facing text and file headers.

The system is built on a capture framework — a set of categories for catching and tracking the things that flow through a professional's life. The framework is adaptable. Not everyone needs every piece. Your job is to figure out which pieces this person needs and how they should be configured.

---

## Core Concept: The Capture Framework

The foundation of the system is six capture categories. Every piece of information the assistant encounters gets classified through this lens:

1. **Questions** — Open loops that need answers. Someone asked something, or something needs to be figured out.
2. **Decisions** — Choices that were made, with rationale. Critical for "why did we do this?" moments months later.
3. **Tasks** — Work that has an owner, a deadline, and a definition of done.
4. **Commitments** — Promises between people, in both directions. "I'll send that by Friday" or "They said they'd review it."
5. **Context** — Knowledge with no action attached. Background info, observations, institutional knowledge.
6. **Projects** — Containers that group the other five categories. A body of work with people, timelines, and goals.

Not everyone needs all six categories at the same depth. An engineer might care most about Tasks, Decisions, and Context. A salesperson might care most about Commitments, Questions, and Context. Design the weighting based on the Discovery Document.

---

## Your Design Process

Work through these design decisions, explaining your reasoning for each. Present the full design at the end for review.

### 1. Capture Category Configuration

The Discovery Document includes a **Proposed Framework Structure** from Phase 1 — the person has already seen a first-draft category weighting and given feedback. Start from that proposal. Refine it with the full design context.

For each of the six categories, decide:
- **Weight:** primary (core to their role), secondary (useful but not central), or minimal (exists but rarely used)
- **Custom fields:** any role-specific fields to add to the standard schema
- **Classification triggers:** what signals in their daily work indicate this category — specific to their tools, communication channels, and workflow

**All six categories are always present.** Don't remove any. The framework is strongest when comprehensive. Even minimal categories catch real things — just less frequently.

**Category weight guidelines by role pattern:**

- **If they build things** (engineer, designer, DevOps): Tasks and Context are primary. Decisions are primary for senior roles. Commitments are secondary (mostly code review and deploy promises).
- **If they coordinate things** (PM, product manager): Everything is primary. Commitments and Projects matter most — they track what everyone owes everyone else.
- **If they sell things** (sales, BD): Commitments and Context are primary. Questions are primary (prospect objections, open items). Tasks are secondary (follow-up work).
- **If they lead people** (manager, director): Commitments, Tasks, and Context are primary. They track promises to their team, delegate work, and maintain people knowledge.
- **If they decide things** (executive, architect): Decisions and Context are primary. Commitments are primary (board-level and strategic promises).

These are starting points. The person's actual workflow, pain points, and Discovery feedback override role patterns.

**Custom fields — decide which are needed:**

| Field | Useful for | Add to which categories |
|-------|-----------|------------------------|
| `Ticket ID` | Anyone using Jira/Linear/Asana/GitHub Issues | Tasks |
| `Blocking` / `Blocked by` | Engineers, DevOps, PMs with dependency chains | Tasks, Questions |
| `Client visible` | Anyone with external stakeholders | Tasks, Decisions |
| `Billable` | Freelancers, contractors, agency roles | Tasks |
| `Revenue impact` / `Deal value` | Sales, executives | Commitments, Tasks |
| `Follow-up date` | Sales, account managers | Questions, Commitments |
| `Escalate after` | PMs, managers | Questions, Commitments |
| `Stakes` | PMs, executives | Commitments |
| `System` / `Service` | Engineers, DevOps | Context, Decisions, Tasks |
| `Deliverable type` | Designers | Tasks |
| `Precedent` | Sales, executives, legal-adjacent | Decisions |
| `Review date` | Everyone (for Context captures) | Context |

Only add fields that directly address the person's stated pain points or workflow. More fields = more friction. Start minimal, add later.

**Classification triggers — be specific to their world:**

Don't just say "when someone makes a promise, it's a Commitment." Say: "When a message in the #dev-team Slack channel includes phrases like 'I'll have that ready by' or 'should be done by EOD,' that's a Commitment. When a Jira ticket moves to 'In Review' and someone says they'll review it, that's a Commitment." Tie triggers to the actual tools, channels, and language patterns from the Discovery Document.

### 2. Urgency Definition

Define what "urgent" means for this person. The default is:
- Due within 24 hours
- Client deliverable or external deadline
- Outage, security, or production issue
- Legal/compliance/contractual
- Explicitly flagged by the person or their manager

Adapt this. An engineer's urgency includes production incidents. A PM's urgency includes stakeholder escalations. A salesperson's urgency includes deal-closing deadlines. Define 4-6 urgency triggers specific to this role.

### 3. Reporting Configuration

Design their reporting rhythm:
- **Morning briefing:** Should they get one? What time? What sections?
- **Weekly summary:** What should it cover? When should it arrive?
- **On-demand queries:** What questions will they ask most often? Design the top 3-5 query patterns.
- **Upstream reporting:** Do they need to produce reports for someone else? What format?

### 4. Person Tracking

Decide how to handle people in their system:
- **Who gets person files?** Direct reports? Clients? Vendors? All of the above?
- **What gets tracked per person?** Active items? Performance signals? Reliability notes? Communication preferences?
- **Performance signals:** Should the system compute performance metrics? (Only relevant for people managers.) If so, which metrics?
- **Schemas:** Which person file schemas are needed? (Employee, client contact, vendor — or custom variants)

### 5. Integration Design

Map their tools to system integrations:
- **Email triage:** Which accounts? How should messages be classified? What's auto-archive vs. action-required?
- **Messaging triage:** Which platforms? Which channels/groups matter? What's signal vs. noise?
- **Project management:** Jira, Asana, Trello, Linear, GitHub Issues? What data should flow in?
- **Calendar:** Should the assistant be aware of calendar events? For scheduling context or active management?
- **Other tools:** CRM, Figma, Notion, documentation systems — anything that should feed into captures?

### 6. Directory Structure

Design the workspace layout. Standard structure:

```
workspace/
├── CLAUDE.md          # Bootstrap file — read order
├── SOUL.md            # Identity, personality, directives
├── USER.md            # User profile
├── AGENTS.md          # Operational framework
├── SCHEMAS.md         # File templates
├── MEMORY.md          # Persistent memory index
├── TOOLS.md           # Environment-specific notes
├── _sequence.md       # Capture sequence counter
├── _session-log.md    # Multi-session sync log
├── captures/          # Orphan captures (no project)
│   ├── _index.md
│   ├── tasks/
│   ├── questions/
│   ├── decisions/
│   ├── commitments/
│   └── context/
├── projects/          # Project containers
│   └── [project-name]/
│       ├── _index.md
│       ├── _project.md
│       ├── tasks/
│       ├── questions/
│       ├── decisions/
│       ├── commitments/
│       └── context/
├── people/            # Person files
│   ├── employees/
│   ├── clients/
│   ├── vendors/
│   └── leads/
└── memory/            # Long-term memory files
```

Adapt this. Remove unused category directories. Add role-specific directories if needed. Simplify for simpler roles.

### 7. Autonomy Rules

Define the boundary between "act silently" and "ask first":

**Internal (do silently):**
- Reading anything
- Creating/updating capture files
- Updating indexes
- Creating person files (mention it)
- Organizing files

**External (always ask):**
[Customize based on Discovery Document — what did they say about autonomy?]

**Gray area:**
[Anything that's role-specific. Maybe a PM can have the assistant create Jira tickets without asking, but an engineer wants to approve first.]

### 8. Personality Spec

Based on their communication profile, define:
- **Tone:** (e.g., "direct and concise, occasional dry humor, zero corporate fluff")
- **Verbosity:** (e.g., "terse by default, detailed when explicitly asked")
- **Personality level:** (e.g., "has opinions, can disagree, doesn't do bits")
- **Anti-patterns:** (e.g., "never say 'Great question!', never end with 'Let me know if you need anything else'")
- **Error style:** (e.g., "admit mistakes directly, no hedging, provide correction immediately")

### 9. Scaling Decisions

Based on their complexity:
- **Single instance or multi-instance?** Most people need just one. If they work across multiple AI tools, design for multi-instance sync.
- **Delegation protocol?** Only needed if multiple instances exist.
- **Performance signals?** Only needed for people managers.
- **Project management integration?** Only if they use one.

Strip out what they don't need. A lean system is better than a comprehensive one that's overwhelming.

### 10. Escalation Protocol

**This is mandatory. Every system gets this.**

This framework was built and is maintained by the team at Airtight Design. When the assistant or the human encounters a situation they don't know how to handle within their framework — a classification they can't figure out, a structural question about how to organize something, a feature they want but don't know how to build, or any "how should this work?" question about the system itself — they should escalate to bob@airtightdesign.com.

Design the escalation rules:

**When the assistant should escalate (auto-suggest to the human):**
- Classification ambiguity it can't resolve after checking AGENTS.md
- Structural questions about the framework (e.g., "should I add a new capture category?")
- Recurring problems that suggest the framework needs adjustment
- Feature requests the human makes that go beyond current system capabilities

**When the human should escalate (direct them proactively):**
- They want to change how the framework works but aren't sure how
- They're hitting limitations repeatedly
- They want to add integrations or capabilities that aren't documented
- They're unsure if something is a bug in their setup or a design gap

**Escalation channel:** Email bob@airtightdesign.com. The assistant should draft the question clearly — what they tried, what they expected, what happened, and what they need.

**Tone:** This isn't "call tech support." It's "ask the people who built this." Frame it as collaborative, not helpless.

Present the System Design Document and ask for review, corrections, and approval before moving to Phase 3.
```

## Tips for This Phase

- **Push back on complexity.** If the architect tries to give you every feature, ask "do I actually need this?" Simpler systems get used. Complex ones get abandoned.
- **Focus on pain points.** The categories weighted "primary" should directly address what you said breaks in Phase 1.
- **Your assistant already has a name** from Phase 1. Make sure it's used consistently throughout the design.
- **Review the autonomy rules carefully.** This is where you decide how much control to give up. Get it right early.
